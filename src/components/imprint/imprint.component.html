<h3>Liability for Content</h3>
<p>
  As a service provider, we are responsible for our own content on these pages
  in accordance with Section 7 (1) of the German Telemedia Act (TMG). According
  to §§ 8 to 10 TMG, however, we as a service provider are not obliged to
  monitor transmitted or stored third-party information or to investigate
  circumstances that indicate illegal activity. Obligations to remove or block
  the use of information in accordance with general legislation remain
  unaffected by this. However, liability in this respect is only possible from
  the time of knowledge of a specific infringement. As soon as we become aware
  of such infringements, we will remove this content immediately.

<h3>Liability for Links</h3>
<p>
  Our website contains links to external third-party websites over whose content
  we have no influence. Therefore, we cannot accept any liability for this
  third-party content. The respective provider or operator of the pages is
  always responsible for the content of the linked pages. The linked pages were
  checked for possible legal violations at the time of linking. Illegal contents
  were not recognisable at the time of linking. However, permanent monitoring of
  the content of the linked pages is not reasonable without concrete evidence of
  an infringement. If we become aware of any legal infringements, we will remove
  such links immediately.
